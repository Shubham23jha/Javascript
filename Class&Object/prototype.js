/*


In JavaScript, the prototype is an internal property of an object that is used for inheritance. Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, except for the base object (Object.prototype), which is at the top of the prototype chain.

When you access a property or method on an object, and JavaScript can't find it on the object itself, it looks up the prototype chain to find the property or method in the object's prototype. This process continues until the property or method is found or until the end of the prototype chain is reached.
